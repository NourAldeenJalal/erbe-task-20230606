# Task for Computer Vision Engineer

A simple deep learning model to classify the esophagitis image data and the Barrett's esophagus image data.

- ResNet50 model was employed and modified to fit the task. The ResNet50 model was pre-trained on a dataset of cholecystectomy images for surgical tool classification. The pre-trained model can be found in '/Pretrained_Model/ResNet50/final_model.h5'

- The final model architecture can be found in '/Scripts/Model_architecture.h5'

- To run the code, please add the images to the project directory. Please also modify 'Project_dir' on line 16.
